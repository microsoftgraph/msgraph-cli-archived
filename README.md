# Microsoft Graph CLI

It is said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and if you are familiar with the Azure CLI, you can tell we are fans. The Microsoft Graph CLI leverages the same tool chain that is used to build the Azure CLI, but instead brings the entire surface area of Microsoft Graph to your command shell.

This project is still in its early phases, but we are building not only on the work of the Azure CLI team but also on the [Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-powershell) project to enable us to quickly generate a CLI for all the new capabilities of Microsoft Graph as soon as they are available.
