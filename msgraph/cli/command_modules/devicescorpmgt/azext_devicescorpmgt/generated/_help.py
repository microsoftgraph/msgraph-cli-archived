example, '157.54.14.28, 157.54.11.118, 10.202.14.167, 157.53.14.163, 157.69.210.59'. These proxies have been \
configured by the admin to connect to specific resources on the Internet. They are considered to be enterprise network \
locations. The proxies are only leveraged in configuring the EnterpriseProxiedDomains policy to force traffic to the \
matched domains through these proxies
            enterprise-ip-ranges: Sets the enterprise IP ranges that define the computers in the enterprise network. \
Data that comes from those computers will be considered part of the enterprise and protected. These locations will be \
considered a safe destination for enterprise data to be shared to
            enterprise-ip-ranges-are-authoritative: Boolean value that tells the client to accept the configured list \
and not to use heuristics to attempt to find other subnets. Default is false
            enterprise-network-domain-names: This is the list of domains that comprise the boundaries of the \
enterprise. Data from one of these domains that is sent to a device will be considered enterprise data and protected \

            enterprise-proxied-domains: Contains a list of Enterprise resource domains hosted in the cloud that need \
to be protected. Connections to these resources are considered enterprise data. If a proxy is paired with a cloud \
resource, traffic to the cloud resource will be routed through the enterprise network via the denoted proxy server (on \
Port 80). A proxy server used for this purpose must also be configured using the EnterpriseInternalProxyServers policy
            enterprise-proxy-servers: This is a list of proxy servers. Any server not on this list is considered \
non-enterprise
            enterprise-proxy-servers-are-authoritative: Boolean value that tells the client to accept the configured \
list of proxies and not try to detect other work proxies. Default is false
            exempt-apps: Exempt applications can also access enterprise data, but the data handled by those \
applications are not protected. This is because some critical enterprise applications may have compatibility problems \
with encrypted data.
            icons-visible: Determines whether overlays are added to icons for WIP protected files in Explorer and \
enterprise only app tiles in the Start menu. Starting in Windows 10, version 1703 this setting also configures the \
visibility of the WIP icon in the title bar of a WIP-protected app
            indexing-encrypted-stores-or-items-blocked: This switch is for the Windows Search Indexer, to allow or \
disallow indexing of items
            is-assigned: Indicates if the policy is deployed to any inclusion groups or not.
            neutral-domain-resources: List of domain names that can used for work or personal resource
            protected-apps: Protected applications can access enterprise data and the data handled by those \
applications are protected with encryption
            protection-under-lock-config-required: Specifies whether the protection under lock feature (also known as \
encrypt under pin) should be configured
            revoke-on-unenroll-disabled: This policy controls whether to revoke the WIP keys when a device unenrolls \
from the management service. If set to 1 (Don't revoke keys), the keys will not be revoked and the user will continue \
to have access to protected files after unenrollment. If the keys are not revoked, there will be no revoked file \
cleanup subsequently.
            rights-management-services-template-id: TemplateID GUID to use for RMS encryption. The RMS template allows \
the IT admin to configure the details about who has access to RMS-protected file and how long they have access
            smb-auto-encrypted-file-extensions: Specifies a list of file extensions, so that files with these \
extensions are encrypted when copying from an SMB share within the corporate boundary
            assignments: Navigation property to list of security groups targeted for policy.
            exempt-app-locker-files: Another way to input exempt apps through xml files
            protected-app-locker-files: Another way to input protected apps through xml files
            created-date-time: The date and time the policy was created.

            days-without-contact-before-unenroll: Offline interval before app data is wiped (days)
            mdm-enrollment-url: Enrollment url for the MDM
            minutes-of-inactivity-before-device-lock: Specifies the maximum amount of time (in minutes) allowed after \
the device is idle that will cause the device to become PIN or password locked.   Range is an integer X where 0 <= X \
<= 999.
            number-of-past-pins-remembered: Integer value that specifies the number of past PINs that can be \
associated to a user account that can't be reused. The largest number you can configure for this policy setting is 50. \
The lowest number you can configure for this policy setting is 0. If this policy is set to 0, then storage of previous \
PINs is not required. This node was added in Windows 10, version 1511. Default is 0.
            password-maximum-attempt-count: The number of authentication failures allowed before the device will be \
wiped. A value of 0 disables device wipe functionality. Range is an integer X where 4 <= X <= 16 for desktop and 0 <= \
X <= 999 for mobile devices.
            pin-expiration-days: Integer value specifies the period of time (in days) that a PIN can be used before \
the system requires the user to change it. The largest number you can configure for this policy setting is 730. The \
lowest number you can configure for this policy setting is 0. If this policy is set to 0, then the user's PIN will \
never expire. This node was added in Windows 10, version 1511. Default is 0.
            pin-minimum-length: Integer value that sets the minimum number of characters required for the PIN. Default \
value is 4. The lowest number you can configure for this policy setting is 4. The largest number you can configure \
must be less than the number configured in the Maximum PIN length policy setting or the number 127, whichever is the \
lowest.
            revoke-on-mdm-handoff-disabled: New property in RS2, pending documentation
            windows-hello-for-business-blocked: Boolean value that sets Windows Hello for Business as a method for \
signing into Windows.
